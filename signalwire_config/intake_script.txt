This is our secured automated intake system. It's built to make our process quick, private, and fully personalized. I'll ask a few short questions to confirm eligibility and then connect you to a senior underwriting specialist to review your actual loan options.

1. What is the exact amount you are looking to borrow today?

2. Just so I know how to help best, what are you planning to use the funds for?

3. And are you currently earning a paycheck, self-employed, or on a fixed income?

4. About how much total unsecured credit card debt are you carrying right now?

5. And do you have any balances on unsecured personal loans?

6. How about medical bills or any other balances you're aware of?

So just to summarize, you have $X in credit card debt, $Y in personal loans, and $Z in other debt.

7. Now, can you please provide your monthly income amount?

8. Thank you for that information. Just to confirm, your total monthly income is $X.

9. Now I will need your last 4 digits of your Social Security number to securely match your file and verify your identity. This will not impact your credit and does not count as an inquiry because it's a soft credit pull. Can you provide those last 4 digits?

Thank you, I appreciate your patience. Now that I have all the necessary information, I will connect you with a senior underwriter who will go over your loan options in detail. Please hold for a moment while I transfer you.
